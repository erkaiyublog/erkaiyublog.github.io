This blog presents a growing collection of papers and tools related to the topic of symbolic execution. I (hopefully ;p) plan to update it regularly, since I want it to serve as a handy index whenever I revisit this topic. 

For each paper or tool listed here, Iâ€™ll include a link to a separate blog post with my notes from reading or studying it. The notes are definitely not *complete*, but I do aim for them to be *sound* (hopefully!).

I collected the related papers by refering to the following surveys/summaries:
1. *A Survey of Symbolic Execution Techniques*, Baldoni et al. [[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.00502)]
2. *Symbolic execution for software testing: Three decades later*, Cadar et al. [[link](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ksen/papers/cacm13.pdf)]
