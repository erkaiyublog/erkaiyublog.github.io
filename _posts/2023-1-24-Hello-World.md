It's 0:30am, Jan 24th, 2023. I'm writing this very first blog on this website.

### Who am I?
By the time these words were typed, I was an undergraduate majored in Computer Engineering, spending my junior year in UIUC campus as an exchange student from ZJU.

My professional webpage is this one -> [https://silkrow.github.io/](https://silkrow.github.io/)

### What's this website about?
I created a new github account to hold this website with github.io, simply because I like how easy it is to hold websites online with github, and I don't like worrying about my content to disappear if I write on some other fancy blog websites, also, I don't have time to buy a server and setup very thing in a more geek way ;).

Most of the blogs written on this website will be highly related with my major, Computer Engineering. I'll cover stuff I learned and found interesting, I'll also include some tips that I want to keep track for future reference. Moreover, some of the blogs will be about funny things and my daily life. 

### What have I written so far?
Before setting up this website, I've written several blogs on [this free website](https://silkrow3.wordpress.com/) hosted by wordpress, among the posts I created there, [the series of notes for CS161](https://silkrow3.wordpress.com/tag/cs161/) was my favourite, I self studied UCB's CS 161: Computer Security during the winter of 2022-2023, and wrote a whole series of blog for the lecture notes. 

### Why should you read my blogs?
;) IDK, maybe for some magical reason you wanted to find out more about me. Or you just happened to click to one of my blogs because of some random advertisements. 

No matter what kind of miracle brought you here, I hope you enjoyed reading my blogs, and I wish that you may find them helpful.
