# Introduction
## Define Computer Security
A collection of properties that hold in a system in the presence
of an adversary under a set of constraints.
## Definitions
* Confidentiality (privacy): Prevent unauthorized parties from accessing certain data/system
* Integrity: Prevent unauthorized parties from tampering with certain data/system
* Availability: Make sure certain data/system is available to users
* Authenticity: Proof of true identity/origin
* Anonymity: Cannot be distinguished from others
* Accountability: The ability to identify the responsible party
## Defenses
* Backups
* Automatic updates
* Two-factor authentication
## 2FA Bypass (Real Time Phishing)
Phish site to ask for 2FA code from user while attacker attempting to login the real site.

# Social Networks
## Homophily
The tendency of individuals to associate and bond with similar others.
* Choice Homophily: Closeness due to preferences by the individual. Example: Favorite teams
* Induced Homophily: Closeness due to other constraints. Examples: Geographic closeness, Age closeness with friends.
* Value Homophily: Individuals with similar values, thinking. Example: Religion
* Status Homophily Individual with similar social status. Example: Aristocracy

## Age Inference
Ages of friends should be similar to that of the user, high-school graduation year of friends should be closer to the high-school graduation of the user.

### Baseline 
Just take the mean / median of the known ages in the whole dataset as the age estimate.

### Approach
1. Train a linear-regression model of Birth Year given the High-school Graduation Year. 
2. For the users with known ages: use them to train the linear-regression model.
3. For the users with HSY, use the model to get estimated BY.
4. For the users without HSY, if enough friends with HSY available, estimate the BY with the most frequent HSY of friends.
5. Iterative approach: for those without enough friends, iteratively estimate the HSY and BY until the whole graph gets covered.

### What if the user has not made their friend list public? 
Use reverse look up.

## Discussion Questions
1. How can social networks be best used by advertisers? (Think like an advertiser or social network vendor)
2. Are there alternative approaches to social networking that may limit inference of attributes about users? (Consider architecture, business models, regulation, etc.)
