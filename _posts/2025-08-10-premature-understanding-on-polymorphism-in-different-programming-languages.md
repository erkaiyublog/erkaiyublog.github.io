title: My Premature Understanding on Polymorphism in Different Programming Languages
tags: 
---

Polymorphism—the ability of different types to be treated uniformly through a common interface—is one of the fundamental concepts in modern programming. As I've been exploring different programming languages, I've noticed how each approaches this concept with its own philosophy and mechanisms. Today, I want to share my understanding of how polymorphism works in three languages I've been studying: C++, Rust, and Go.

*Disclaimer: As the title suggests, this represents my current, possibly incomplete understanding. I'm still learning, and these perspectives may evolve as I gain more experience.*

## What is Polymorphism?

Before diving into language-specific implementations, let's establish what we mean by polymorphism. In programming, polymorphism allows us to write code that works with objects of different types, as long as they share a common interface or behavior. This enables us to write more flexible, reusable code.

There are generally two main types of polymorphism:
- **Static (compile-time) polymorphism**: Resolved at compile time through mechanisms like function overloading and templates
- **Dynamic (runtime) polymorphism**: Resolved at runtime through mechanisms like virtual functions and interfaces

## Polymorphism in C++

C++ offers multiple approaches to achieve polymorphism, making it both powerful and complex.

### Static Polymorphism with Templates

C++ templates provide compile-time polymorphism through generic programming:

```cpp
template<typename T>
void printValue(const T& value) {
    std::cout << value << std::endl;
}

// Works with any type that supports operator<<
printValue(42);           // int
printValue("Hello");      // const char*
printValue(3.14);         // double
```

### Dynamic Polymorphism with Virtual Functions

C++ achieves runtime polymorphism through inheritance and virtual functions:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;  // Pure virtual function
    virtual ~Shape() = default;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;
public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    double area() const override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
private:
    double width, height;
public:
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}
    double area() const override {
        return width * height;
    }
};

// Polymorphic usage
void printArea(const Shape& shape) {
    std::cout << "Area: " << shape.area() << std::endl;
}

Circle c(5);
Rectangle r(4, 6);
printArea(c);  // Calls Circle::area()
printArea(r);  // Calls Rectangle::area()
```

**Strengths**: Very flexible, supports both static and dynamic polymorphism, zero-cost abstractions with templates.

**Challenges**: Complex syntax, potential for runtime overhead with virtual functions, inheritance hierarchies can become unwieldy.

## Polymorphism in Rust

Rust takes a different approach, emphasizing zero-cost abstractions and memory safety while providing powerful polymorphic capabilities.

### Static Polymorphism with Generics and Traits

Rust's primary polymorphism mechanism uses traits (similar to interfaces) with generics:

```rust
trait Drawable {
    fn draw(&self);
}

struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

struct Rectangle {
    width: f64,
    height: f64,
}

impl Drawable for Circle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing circle with radius {}", self.radius);
    }
}

impl Drawable for Rectangle {
    fn draw(&self) {
        println!("Drawing rectangle {}x{}", self.width, self.height);
    }
}

// Static polymorphism - monomorphized at compile time
fn render<T: Drawable>(shape: &T) {
    shape.draw();
}

let circle = Circle { radius: 5.0 };
let rectangle = Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 6.0 };
render(&circle);     // No runtime overhead
render(&rectangle);  // No runtime overhead
```

### Dynamic Polymorphism with Trait Objects

When runtime polymorphism is needed, Rust uses trait objects:

```rust
fn render_dynamic(shape: &dyn Drawable) {
    shape.draw();
}

let shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Drawable>> = vec![
    Box::new(Circle { radius: 5.0 }),
    Box::new(Rectangle { width: 4.0, height: 6.0 }),
];

for shape in &shapes {
    render_dynamic(shape.as_ref());
}
```

**Strengths**: Zero-cost static polymorphism, memory safety guarantees, explicit about when dynamic dispatch is used.

**Challenges**: Steeper learning curve, trait objects have some limitations (object safety rules), borrowing and lifetime complexities.

## Polymorphism in Go

Go takes a minimalist approach to polymorphism through interfaces, emphasizing simplicity and implicit satisfaction.

### Interface-Based Polymorphism

Go's interfaces are satisfied implicitly—any type that implements the required methods automatically satisfies the interface:

```go
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}

type Circle struct {
    radius float64
}

type Rectangle struct {
    width, height float64
}

// Circle implements Shape interface implicitly
func (c Circle) Area() float64 {
    return 3.14159 * c.radius * c.radius
}

// Rectangle implements Shape interface implicitly
func (r Rectangle) Area() float64 {
    return r.width * r.height
}

func printArea(s Shape) {
    fmt.Printf("Area: %.2f\n", s.Area())
}

circle := Circle{radius: 5}
rectangle := Rectangle{width: 4, height: 6}
printArea(circle)    // Works automatically
printArea(rectangle) // Works automatically
```

### The Empty Interface and Type Assertions

Go's `interface{}` (or `any` in Go 1.18+) can hold any type, providing maximum flexibility:

```go
func printAnything(value interface{}) {
    switch v := value.(type) {
    case string:
        fmt.Printf("String: %s\n", v)
    case int:
        fmt.Printf("Integer: %d\n", v)
    case Shape:
        fmt.Printf("Shape with area: %.2f\n", v.Area())
    default:
        fmt.Printf("Unknown type: %T\n", v)
    }
}

printAnything("Hello")
printAnything(42)
printAnything(Circle{radius: 3})
```

**Strengths**: Simple and intuitive, implicit interface satisfaction, excellent readability.

**Challenges**: No generics until recently (Go 1.18), potential runtime panics with type assertions, less compile-time safety compared to statically typed polymorphism.

## Comparing the Approaches

| Aspect | C++ | Rust | Go |
|--------|-----|------|-----|
| **Static Polymorphism** | Templates | Generics + Traits | Generics (Go 1.18+) |
| **Dynamic Polymorphism** | Virtual functions | Trait objects | Interfaces |
| **Performance** | Zero-cost templates, vtable overhead for virtual | Zero-cost static, minimal dynamic overhead | Interface method calls have small overhead |
| **Safety** | Runtime errors possible | Compile-time safety guarantees | Runtime panics possible |
| **Complexity** | High | Medium-High | Low |
| **Interface Satisfaction** | Explicit inheritance | Explicit implementation | Implicit satisfaction |

## My Current Thoughts

Each language's approach to polymorphism reflects its design philosophy:

- **C++** gives you maximum power and flexibility but requires careful handling of complexity
- **Rust** prioritizes safety and performance while still providing expressive polymorphism
- **Go** emphasizes simplicity and readability, making polymorphism approachable but sometimes less precise

As I continue learning, I'm finding that understanding these different approaches helps me think about problem-solving in new ways. C++'s templates teach me about compile-time computation, Rust's trait system shows me how to think about behavior composition, and Go's interfaces demonstrate the power of simplicity.

## Conclusion

Polymorphism isn't just about the technical mechanisms—it's about designing flexible, maintainable code. Each language offers different tools for this goal, and the "best" choice depends on your specific needs: performance requirements, team expertise, project constraints, and personal preferences.

My understanding continues to evolve as I build more projects and encounter new challenges. What I've shared here represents my current perspective, and I'm sure future-me will have corrections and additions to make.

What's your experience with polymorphism in these languages? Have you found patterns or approaches that work particularly well for your use cases?
