title: Kernel Testing Papers and Tools Collection
tags: paper-reading
---

This blog presents a growing collection of papers and tools related to the topic of kernel testing. I (hopefully ;p) plan to update it regularly, since I want it to serve as a handy index whenever I revisit this topic. 

For each paper or tool listed here, I’ll include a link to a separate page with my notes from reading or studying it. The notes are definitely not *complete*, but I do aim for them to be *sound* (hopefully!).

I collected the related papers by refering to the following surveys/summaries:
1. *A Survey of Fuzzing Open-Source Operating Systems*, Kun et al. [[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13163)]
2. *Demystifying OS Kernel Fuzzing with a Novel Taxonomy*, Jiacheng et al. [[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16165)]
