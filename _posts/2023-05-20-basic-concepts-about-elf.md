_Ever since I started learning operating system, I've been struggling with some basic concepts involving executable files (e.g. what is the difference between static and dynamic libraries? how does the memory layout look like for an executable? how does an executable fit in different operating systems?). Having some vague answers to these questions in mind might be enough for me to write decent codes. However, since I've been working on a project related to software analysis, I decided to do some search to draw a clearer picture of these topics and write this blog to record what I've learned._

questions:
	1. What is a static library, what is a dynamic library?
	2. What is an ELF file?
	3. What is a typical memory layout of an executable, who is deciding that?
	4. What is system V?
	5. What is the process of loading an executable? 
	6. What are some common tools to analyze a given executable file?
