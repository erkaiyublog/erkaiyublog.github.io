Following [*How to Read an Engineering Research Paper*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html), I tried to summarize this paper by answering the questions below.

## What are the motivations for this work?

* See Introduction, Section 2.
### Limitation of Existing Works
* There are limitations in the existing firmware security testing approaches when applied to embedded firmware testing:
![table1](/images/posts/microafl/table1.png)
* Specifically, in the Introduction section, the authors categorized the existing firmware security testing approaches as:
    * **Emulation-based rehosting technique** (extensively studied recently): the main challenge is to accurately model the behavior of diverse peripherals. Some attempted to learn an approximate peripheral model using symbolic execution, access-pattern matching, and machine learning techniques, but they are inaccurate in general.
    * **Porting based on HAL**: leverage the HAL available in MCU firmware to avoid modeling peripherals. Limited to peripheral drivers that are available in HAL.
    * **Hardware in the loop**: QEMU + peripheral I/O fowarding. Require frequent and expensive switching (and syncing) between QEMU and hardware.
### Difficulty with MCU
* In Section 2, the authors introduced the difficulty in dynamic analysis of MCU firmware. Unlike traditional software which assumes an OS layer that provides an abstract view of hardware, MCU firmware **runs on bare metal** or only includes an OS library (e.g. RTOS) for simple multi-task management. Therefore, it compiles the driver code of peripherals and the application code **together to form a single-address-space program**. The peripheral I/O operation is performed by accessing the memory-mapped registers.

## What is the proposed solution?

* See Introduction, Section 2.
### Hardware
* Use ARM ETM (Embedded Trace Macrocell) for non-intrusive feedback collection.
* ETM is a hardware instruction trace feature for ARM. The design of ETM is: A dedicated hardware component emits a stream of control flow packets, a decoder reconstructs a unique execution path by matching the control flow data to the disassembled machine code.
### Trace Collection
* For trace collection, in the documentation of ETM there were two different ways. However, the authors found that ETB (Embedded Trace Buffer) is **rarely supported on real chips**. They instead use a physical parallel port called [Cortex Debug+ETM connector](https://documentation-service.arm.com/static/5fce6c49e167456a35b36af1) to stream the trace data to an external debugger.

## What is the work's evaluation of the proposed solution?

See Section 4.
* Implemented a prototype of ùúáAFL on top of AFL2.56 by adding ‚àº2,000 lines of C code on the PC side.
* Used the SEGGER J-Trace Pro debug dongle to control the communication between the host PC and the target ARM Cortex-M evaluation boards.
* Experiments were done to NXP TWR-K64F120M and STM32H7B3I-EVAL. Used the sample code provided in NXP SDK and STM32 SDK.

## What is your analysis of the identified problem, idea and evaluation?

## What are the contributions?

* See Introduction.
* ùúáAFL, the first fuzzing tool that is applicable to the driver code of MCU firmware.
* Proposed using ARM ETM for non-intrusive feedback collection. Used Linear Code Sequence And Jump (LCSAJ) analysis to directly process raw ETM data without expensive disassembling.
* Some bugs detected.
