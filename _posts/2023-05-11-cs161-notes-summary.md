title: CS 161 Notes Series Introduction
tags: cs161 security

This is a series of notes for course CS 161: Computer Security held by UCB. I watched the recordings of its Summer 2021 version during winter holiday, 2023. The course website can be found [here](https://su21.cs161.org/). After that, I took [ECE 422: Introduction to Computer Security](https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/ece422/sp2023/) in UIUC during Spring 2023, the course structure was roughly the same as CS 161. 

I've post [my notes for cs 161](https://silkrow3.wordpress.com/tag/cs161/) on my previous blog website held on wordpress, but later I realized that the ADs attached by wordpress were really annoying so I decided to copy the posts to here. Unfortunately, migration of the posts from wordpress to markdown might not be that satisfying, so if you find the posts hard to read in format, feel free to comment below and I'll fix that if I can.

If you wish to learn something about basic computer security or prepare to take some course like ECE 422 in UIUC, I think watching CS 161 is definitely an excellent choice. My own notes are likely not gonna be helpful for learning all the things from the beginning, but it might work well as a reference sheet for review or quickly look up some concepts. I personally referred to my posts when preparing finals for ECE 422 and it turned out to be really helpful. 

Hope you'd enjoy reading this series of posts! :)
