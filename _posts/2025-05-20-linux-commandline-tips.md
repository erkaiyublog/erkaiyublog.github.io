* ```pushd <path>``` moves to the path and save the current directory.
    * ```popd``` to return to the saved directory.

# Git
## Branch
* In case of ambiguity between file names and branch names (e.g. when both a file and a branch are named as ```object```).
    * ```git checkout object --``` to checkout branch.
    * ```git checkout -- object``` to checkout file.

# Grep
* ```-n``` displays line numbers.
* ```-c``` displays **just** the total number of matching lines.

    * ```x``` shows processes not attached to a terminal.
    * ```w``` shows wide output (to include the entire command line).
    * ```f``` shows processes in a tree format.

# Objdump
* ```-z``` shows all symbols (to include those with zero values).
* To perform objdump on arm binary, 
    * For bare-metal, install ```binutils-arm-none-eabi```, and use ```arm-none-eabi-objdump```.
    * For arm64, install ```binutils-aarch64-linux-gnu```, and use ```aarch64-linux-gnu-objdump```.

# Echo
* ```echo $?``` displays the return value of the most recently run program.

# Set
* When writing a shell script, use ```set -e``` at the beginning to specify that the script should exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status.
