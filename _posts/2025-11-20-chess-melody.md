Nov 20, 2025. For the first time ever, I reached 2300 in Blitz on Chess.com, along with an astonishing 11-game winning streak. I'm simply writing this blog post to share my happiness.

Below is a screenshot of my Blitz rating stat, for the past 90 days I gained 387 ELO points.

Lastly, it’s worth pointing out that with a Blitz rating of 2304, my rank among all Chinese players on Chess.com reached 247!
