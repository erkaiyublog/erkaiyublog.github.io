# Q&A ([link](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/howtoread.html))

**What are the motivations for this work?** 
* See Abstract, Introduction.
* Currently available virtualization systems face limitations due to overhead and security concerns.
* Multiplexing in between processes can be applied in between operating systems. Although running an OS is more heavyweight than running a process, both in terms of initialization and in terms of resource consumption, it's worth paying this price for virtualized operating systems.  

**What is the proposed solution?**
* See Section 2, Section 3.
* A set of design principles:
    * Support for unmodified application binaries is essential, or users will not transition to Xen. Hence we must virtualize all architectural features required by existing standard ABIs.
    * Supporting full multi-application operating systems is important, as this allows complex server configurations to be virtualized within a single guest OS instance.
    * Paravirtualization is necessary to obtain high performance and strong resource isolation on uncooperative machine architectures such as x86.
    * Even on cooperative machine architectures, completely hiding the effects of resource virtualization from guest OSes **risks both correctness and performance** (an example is the TCP timeout and RTT estimation by the guest OS needs real time to be more precise).
* **Paravirtualization** done for x86 architecture:

* The overall system structure of Xen:

* The hypervisor itself provides **only basic control operations**. 
* *Domain0* runs control software that manages the entire server (e.g. can create and destroy domains, set network filters and routing rules, monitor per-domain network activity at packet and flow granularity, and create and delete virtual network interfaces and virtual block device). 


**What is the work's evaluation of the proposed solution?**
* See Section 6.
* Higher coverage.
