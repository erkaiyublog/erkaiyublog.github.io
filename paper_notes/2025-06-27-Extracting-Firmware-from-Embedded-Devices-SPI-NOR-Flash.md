> One of the first things you have to do when hacking and breaking embedded device security is to obtain the firmware. If you're lucky, you can download it from the manufacturer's website or, if you have a shell, you can just copy it over to your computer. But what if none of these options are available?

> In this video, we will show you how you can connect directly to a NOR flash chip with the SPI protocol to dump the firmware and find your vulns, even if off the shelf tools don't work!

Key takeaway: The use of two tools for analyzing SPI communication, namely, **saleae** and **hydrabus**.
